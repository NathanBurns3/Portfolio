  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="imageTextContainer">
    <p>
      I'm a second-year Information Technology student at the University of
      Cincinnati. I am pursuing my BS in Information Technology with a focus on
      Software Application Development. Additionally, I have the opportunity to
      graduate with a Master of Business Administration through the esteemed
      University of Cincinnati IT Accelerated Program. While completing my MBA I
      will learn broad business concepts from an IT perspective and apply that
      specialized view to problem-solving, communication, and hands-on skills.
      Complementing my studies, I will also obtain a minor in Computer Science
      to further enhance my theoretical knowledge and dive deep into the
      algorithms that drive today's computers. <br /><br />

      Ever since I can remember, I've been deeply invested in technology. My
      father's work in IT introduced me to various areas within his office at a
      young age. At the age of 12, I began taking engineering classes, but it
      wasn't until my sophomore year of high school that I truly fell in love
      with coding. Since then, I have enrolled in every computer science class
      available and continuously pursued personal projects. Now at the
      University of Cincinnati, I can do what I love every day and expand my
      knowledge of today's technology. <br /><br />

      During the past summer, I had the valuable opportunity to work as a QA
      Software Tester Co-op at London Computer Systems. In this role, I designed
      unique test cases to evaluate various aspects of the company's property
      management software, Rent Manager. Through this experience, I expanded my
      technical knowledge and gained a profound understanding of the Software
      Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
